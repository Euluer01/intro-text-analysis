## Course description

Despite the recent proliferation in digital sources for a variety of literary fields and subfields, quantitative textual analysis has often been viewed as anathema to pursuits in the humanities. Rather than set computational and literary methods at odds, this course seeks to reconcile them through careful application of statistical methodologies alongside literary modes of inquiry. Far from a positivistic approach to literary texts, this course will guide students towards enriching their understanding of the texts that they study by taking a “distant reading” approach (cf. Moretti 2000) that complements, rather than supplants, close reading and critical analysis.

This course introduces humanists to the tools and methodologies of quantitative textual analysis through corpus linguistics. Using the Python programming language and interactive Jupyter notebooks, students will learn how to build and evaluate corpora related to their areas of expertise, and they will gain experience with basic statistics and probability theory, hypothesis testing and experiment design, and methods in sociolinguists, stylistics, and diachronic textual analysis. Students will gain substantial practical experience through weekly labs and homework assignments, culminating in a final presentation and paper aimed at publication.
